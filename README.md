# Authentication and Minting with PKP Lit

Welcome to our GitHub repository for our latest project, focused on authentication and minting with PKP Lit. We are excited to share this project with you and hope it will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this topic.

## What is PKP Lit?

PKP Lit stands for Public Key Pinning with Lightweight Internet Transactions. It is a security mechanism that helps to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that the public key presented by a server matches the expected public key. This helps to prevent attackers from intercepting and modifying data between the client and server.

## What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In the context of our project, we will be focusing on authentication for PKP Lit, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the system.

## What is Minting?

Minting is the process of creating a new digital asset or token. In our project, we will be exploring how minting can be used in conjunction with PKP Lit to securely create and manage digital assets.
